I am currently a computer science major at CSUF and I plan to graduate in the year 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 6, Part 2: 
    This was a lab that, although frustrating to a certain degree, was a very fun lab to work through. As it required a lot of debugging to ensure that we were evaluating the inputs from the command line, so that our functions for reading the inputs and assigning the values would actually work. Which involved working out how the if statement required the use of the “||” (or the “And” character). Finally tying together our whole piece of code, and giving us the result we wanted. Which was a very pleasing accomplishment.

* Lab 5, Part 2: 
    This was another lab that I found the debugging process to have been very satisfying. As once I had written out the entire code, there was an issue with the output producing a 0 in several instances, where the value should have been something else. So in order to find the issue, I was able to streamline the issue to being that of a logic error, as the output had a variable that was correct, which was in fact the input. Meaning that as a result, it must have been an issue with how I was doing the math. This would also make sense, as I felt that the usage of so many variables (at this time), had very much overwhelmed my mental stack. However, thanks to the search function in VS code, I was able to recognize that one of the variables that was inside the equation was the wrong variable, and instantly fixed my problem. It was a process that taught me a lot, and I was very proud of the process that I took to solve it.

* Lab 10, Part 1: 
    This was a lab that I enjoyed, as it proved challenging, as I had to recollect how to go through a vector and pull out the values that I needed to use. Which had proved to be challenging as I was unsure for the most part. Until I went through the flowchart and notes that me and my partner took, on vectors and loops. Which then enabled us to gain a semblance of how we would write out the code to accomplish the goal we wanted. One of my problems this semester was my lack of confidence in being able to write loops, however this lab helped assure myself that I could understand it, and apply the concepts we learned where we needed to utilize it most. Overall it was a very prideful lab completion, as we were even able to complete it in class.
